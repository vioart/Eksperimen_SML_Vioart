The University of Virginia (UVA) Health Sciences Library received two Health Information Outreach awards from NNLM SEA, located at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Over the span of 1.5 years, UVA partnered with local and regional non-profit and public organizations to create new or enhanced health literacy programming and services in the local health district. The grants were administered and partnerships developed by Lydia Witman, a UVA medical librarian who is a health literacy advocate and consumer health specialist, and who manages the hospital's Patient & Family Library. Local partner organizations included the city's mental health and wellness coalition, the regional public library system, and more.The librarian was able to support the needs of the community by helping community-based organizations identify their own needs and formulate their own solutions. Not only were organizations educated about what health literacy is and how it affects health outcomes and well-being, they were also given grant funds to complete health literacy-related work with the populations they serve.  Instead of creating a prefabricated program, service, or learning experience, the librarian listened to the needs of each organization and helped them formulate their own plans. Providing contacts and connections was also valuable; for example, one organization working with refugees and other vulnerable populations wanted to focus on creating Arabic and Spanish language translations of some of their print material; the librarian was able to provide a list of recommended translation vendors for health-related documents.

Summary: There are many online and in-person courses available for librarians to learn about research data management, data analysis, and visualization, but after you have taken a course, how do you go about applying what you have learned? While it is possible to just start offering classes and consultations, your service will have a better chance of becoming relevant if you consider stakeholders and review your institutional environment. This lecture will give you some ideas to get started with data services at your institution.Presenter Bio: Margaret Henderson is the Health Sciences Librarian at San Diego State University Library.

We step through case studies and show you how to quickly display relevant NCBI track sets — including the new RefSeq Functional Elements track, upload a file or remotely-hosted dataset and display these data as a track, and use browser tracks to identify known variants, then assess variant significance (functional and clinical) and allele frequency.

The GRAF-pop function is also built into a CGI, and you can now find links on many dbGaP study records, called dbGaP estimated ancestry components, that use the CGI to display the study's ancestry relationships.
